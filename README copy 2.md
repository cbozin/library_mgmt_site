(I made a mistake in the first video so I re-recorded the end of it in a seperate video)

## How to Run
To run this code, you need to have an integrated development environment from which you can run a Javascript file. You also need to be able to use NodeJS and Express. 
The application runs locally, so you just need to go to 'localhost:3000' on your machine. Also, this code contains information from my personal database on the MariaDB server,
so it requires a config file to run (that I have not included here).

## Organization
The bulk of the code is in library.js, but there are also a handful of html files as well as .sql files that contain the insert and create table statements for the database used in this program. The 'docs' folder contains the powerpoint and ER diagram.
